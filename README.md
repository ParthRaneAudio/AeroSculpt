AeroSculpt Wind System

A lightweight, Blueprint-based "procedural wind simulation plugin" for Unreal Engine 5, designed for dynamic audio environments.

This plugin is part of the Envirosonics demo: a collection of systems built to breathe sonic life into interactive game worlds.

Apologies for the messy folder organization in advance hehe. Everything is under Procedural_Forest/Maps/AeroSculpt
